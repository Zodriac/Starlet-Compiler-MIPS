# Starlet-Compiler-MIPS

The current project refers to a whole semester project as part of the course "Compilers" wich is one of the core courses during the 8th semester of my undergaduate program on Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Ioannina. The purpose of this project is to create a compiler for a new - non existing - programming language called "Starlet", that works on MIPS.
